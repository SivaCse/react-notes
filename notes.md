# React

React is often called a framework but it is actually more of a library. A framework is generally an "all in one" system where you model your project, files and code to what the framework requires. React, in its most basic form is just a "component-building library". The idea is that you focus on building individual components, then put those together to build a full app.

There are a tonne of additional (optional) react-specific tools that you can choose from, e.g. *react-router*, *redux*, *enzyme*, *create-react-app*, etc. Once you start pulling all these tools together, it starts to resemble a framework.
