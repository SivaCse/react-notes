# Redux

Redux is am open-source library for managing and centralizing state in a JavaScript app (most commonly used with React or Angular). It provides a way for all of your components to work and communicate with a centralized store of all your state values and logic.

Much of Redux's functionality can be replicated/replaced with the `useContext` and `useReducer` hooks. Many people are switching over to the Context hook as Redux tends to be verbose, difficult to pick up and introduces a lot of unnecessary complexity. In addition, using teh Context hook means one less library to install and manage. See [context.md](context.md).
