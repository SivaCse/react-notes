# react notes


## description

In the same spirit as my [python notes](https://github.com/jessicarush/python-notes) and [javascript notes](https://github.com/jessicarush/javascript-notes), I'll be using this repo to collect my notes and examples as I learn React and React Native. Filenames reflect the topic as much as possible. The data directory contains resources for some of the examples. My training is self-guided through the use of text books and online courses/resources listed below.


## credits

Some examples and notes come from the following:

- [The Road to Learn React](https://eloquentjavascript.net) - *Robin Wieruch*  
- [The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context,NextJS, Router)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) - *Colt Steele*  



A very special thanks to [aleph2c](https://github.com/aleph2c) for so, so, much support. Check out his epic [python statechart library; Miros here](https://aleph2c.github.io/miros/index.html).
